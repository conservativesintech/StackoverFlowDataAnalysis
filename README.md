# Data Science Programming Task
This repository contains the Data Analysis of Stackoverlow Posts for two tags (e.g., “wordpress” and “drupal”)  within a 6-month period (e.g., "01/2021-06/2021”). The repository contains the data extracted using big query api and the jupyter notebooks that are needed to perform an indepth analysis on the csv files of the two tags (e.g., “wordpress” and “drupal”). 

The following are the two types of Data Analysis techniques which were performed: 

1. Generate Shaded Density Plots with Rug Plot to understand the differences in distribution of the five different metrics (i.e., Answer Count, Comment Count, Favorite Count, View Count, Score) between the posts of the two tags (i.e.,  “wordpress” and “drupal”)

2. Generate Time Series Plots to understand the topical trend of the five different metrics (i.e., Answer Count, Comment Count, Favorite Count, View Count, Score) over the creation Date intervals between the posts of the two tags (i.e.,  “wordpress” and “drupal”)
